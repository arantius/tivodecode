	* add an option to not process video - handy if all you want is to
	  dump the metadata

	* fix error in logic rework to get prepare_frame to take stream_id and
	  block_id of 0, caused improper decryption of mpeg data

	* add string.h include to md5 to make it work on solaris (seems
	  memmove comes from there), remove sys/param.h since I don't know why
	  it was there and don't know its portability

	* add support to decrypt metadata and dump out to files.  Needs some
	  work to make it easier to use

	* add md5 routines from postgresql's pgcrypto contrib module, slightly
	  hacked so that it does not require a 64-bit integer type, which should
	  not be an issue for my uses.  md5 is needed to generate the decryption
	  keys for the metadata

	* fix turing_stream to work with stream_id of 0
	  (needed for work on metadata decrypting)

	* refactor tivo file parsing to expose access to the rest of the data
	  in the headers and other data chunks

0.2pre2:

	* fix merge error - some includes were in the wrong place, resulting
	  in broken builds due to missing defines from tdconfig.h

0.2pre1:

	* port upstream changes from postgresql's getopt* files, which remove
	  the advertising clause from the license on the file

	* add headers to Makefile.am for installation, clean up headers that
	  will be installed so that one just includes tivodecoder.h, clean up
	  tivodecoder.c so that it does not call exit() since it is called
	  from a lib and the caller may not want to exit, instead return -2

	* copy changes to getopt_long.h from t2sami: don't declare extern vars
	  for getopt if using the system's getopt - rely on it taking care of
	  that.  Caused issue for t2sami on cygwin, tivodecode worked fine,
	  but may as well fix it here too

	* openbsd compile fixes - ntohl requires sys/types.h

	* redo define for ftello/fseeko to be more robust, add warning if
	  falling back to ftell/fseek for questionable large file support

	* clean up types to prevent warnings on windows.  fix up large
	  file support for windows

	* build a library capable of being called by something other than
	  the command line tivodecode program

	* rewrite handling of encrypted packets to not have a hardcoded set of
	  stream_ids, but to keep track of an arbitrary number of states in a
	  circular linked list.	There should never be more than 2 or 3 of
	  them, AFAIK, so this should be acceptable performance-wise

0.1.4:

	* add support for storing MAK in a config file, ~/.tivodecode_mak, or
	  if HOME (or USERPROFILE on Windows) is not set, /.tivodecode_mak
	  (C:/.tivodecode_mak on Windows)

	* tweak largefile support to be more correct for seek and tell, per
	  report in forum.  This should not affect anyone, as in order for pipe
	  support to work I could not seek anyway.

0.1.3:

	* implement support for encrypted packet type 0xbd, apparently used
	  for AC3 audio for 'Humax DVD-burning TiVos'

0.1.2:

	* fix bug introduced recently while fixing signedness warnings on
	  gcc-4.1.  Thanks to tateu for the fix

0.1.1:

	* change include file for htonl after compile farm failure on Mac OSX

0.1.0:

	* apply mak verification patch from Kees Cook
	  <kees@outflux.net>, fix signedness warnings in gcc 4.1, add
	  permission statement from Kees Cook to file derived from mpegcat
