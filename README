tivodecode (c) 2006, Jeremy Drake
CVS Head version
See COPYING for license terms.

To build on a *NIX platform, first check the Makefile, setting CC, CFLAGS and
LDFLAGS as appropriate for your platform.  If your platform has a different way
of building with large file support, correct the DEFINES variable for your
platform.  Then run 'make'.

To build on Windows, a Visual C++ Express 2005 solution file is included.  If
you have a working installation of this compiler, building should be as simple
as opening this solution file and building the tivodecode project.

The parameters (from --help) are documented below.

Usage: ./objects.dir/tivodecode [--help] [--verbose|-v] [--no-verify|-n] {--mak|-m} mak [{--out|-o} outfile] <tivofile>

  --mak, -m        media access key (required)
  --out, -o        output file (default stdout)
  --verbose, -v    verbose
  --no-verify, -n  do not verify MAK while decoding
  --help           print this help and exit

The file names specified for the output file or the tivo file may be -, which
means stdout or stdin respectively
